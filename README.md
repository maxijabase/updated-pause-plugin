# Updated Pause Plugin

This is an updated version of [F2's pause plugin](https://github.com/F2/F2s-sourcemod-plugins/tree/master/pause) further improved by:
- [Aad](https://github.com/l-Aad-l/updated-pause-plugin), fixing uber being built during pause
- [sappho](https://github.com/sapphonie/updated-pause-plugin), modernizing dependencies

I updated it to v1.5, updating/modernizing syntax and fixing [this uber deployment bug upon unpause](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKruu8fCo_4)
